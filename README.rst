Limelight Raspberry Pi Bridge for FTC Tuning Purposes
=====================================================

About This Project
===================

**The purpose of this project is to build a Raspberry Pi-based bridge that allows:**

- The FTC Control Hub to access the Limelight normally (for use in OpModes)
- An external laptop to access the Limelight's web client simultaneously (for debugging and tuning)

Of course, **this solution is not legal for use in competitions** and is intended solely for **tuning and development purposes**.  
However, it dramatically accelerates vision pipeline refinement at a moderate cost.

Huge thanks to this `Pi5 USB gadget configuration guide`_ . I was about to give up because all the internet and ChatGPT kept telling me that USB gadget was not possible on Pi5.
This guide was a lifesaver.
